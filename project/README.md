For the big project, I plan on working with the [TravisTorrent](http://2017.msrconf.org/#/challenge) dataset. 

One of my ideas was to do feature selection to see which features best help to predict whether a build is gonna fail, error, or pass. 

Another idea, in addition to the above, is to look at which prediction algorithms have better results for this specific type of data, potentially tune them.
