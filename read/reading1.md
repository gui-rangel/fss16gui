###ii. Keywords

    ii1. Defect Prediction: By using machine learning techniques, we can predict whether a prticular file has a chance of introducing bugs. The better the techniques used, the more reliable the predictions will be.
    
    ii2. Effort Estimation: By also using machine learning techniques, it tries to predict how much effort (for instance programmer's hours) it'll take for a determined problem or issue to be resolved.
    
    ii3. Prediction Model: We can use machine learning algorithms and techniques, combined with a dataset, to build a prediction model that can be reused multiple times for different datasets, in order to predict an unknown value.
    
    ii4. Local X Global Models: To build a prediction model, we need a dataset. However, there are differences and advantages in either using the entire dataset (to build a global model) or using particular subsets of the dataset (to build local models).
