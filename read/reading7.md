###ii. Keywords

ii1. Software Defect: Parts of the software (certain files or lines within the file) can have unwanted and unplanned errors in them, usually called bugs. Those defects often were put in by mistake, or can also be that different programs were not appropiatedly connected together. There can be multiple reasons for a defect to appear, but while some might be minor, others can be crucial to the correct behavior of the program.

ii3. Prediction Model: We can use machine learning algorithms and techniques, combined with a dataset, to build a prediction model that can be reused multiple times for different datasets, in order to predict an unknown value.

ii2. Defect Prediction: By using machine learning, data mining and statistics techniques it's possible to predict, within a degree of certainty, whether certain parts of a software is likely to have defects. Defect prediction is a primordial research topic, as it's crucial to assign personnel and/or resources to areas of a software system with a higher probable quantity of bugs.

ii4. Classification Models: In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known. By creating a classification model, one can classify new data points as they come in.
